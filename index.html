          Night Vale is described as a small town in the desert, likley in the American Southwest. Outsides new to the town have frequently stated that it is hard to find, and while Cecil has alluded to leaving, it seems most of the townsfolk never do. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Night Vale is a bizarre little town, full of mishaps, monsters, and miracles. The librarians are vicious monsters, the diners serve invisible pie, and the waitresses and part tree. The secret police hide behind bushes and dogs are not allowed in the dog park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, however terrifying the ongoings may be, the town is full of charming people with a strong sense of community.

          The living tell the dying not to leave, and the dying do not listen. The dying tell us not to be sad for them, and we do not listen. The dialogue between the living and the dead is full of misunderstanding and silence.

          We will never be the same again. But here’s a little secret for you—no one is ever the same thing again after anything. You are never the same twice, and much of your unhappiness comes from trying to pretend that you are. Accept that you are different each day, and do so joyfully, recognizing it for the gift it is. Work within the desires and goals of the person you are currently, until you aren’t that person anymore, and everything changes once again. (ep 75)
        </p>
        <p>
          Worry less about the person you once were. Or the person you dream you someday will be. Worry about the person you are now. Or don’t even worry! Just be that person. Be the best version of that person you can be. Be a better version than any of the other versions in any of the many parallel universes. Check regularly online to see the rankings

          Sleep heavily and know that I am here with you. The past is gone, and cannot harm you anymore. And while the future is fast coming for you, it always flinches first, and settles in as the gentle present. This now, this us, we can cope with that. We can do this together you and I.

          I do not know what the rumbling is. I do not know why some doors work and others do not. I do not know why my phone never loses battery power and can heal itself. I do not know how long it will take me to pursue this knowledge. But I do know two things. / What is that? / I love you. / I love you, too. What’s the other thing? / You just said it.

          Today’s episode is brought to you by the concept of stasis. Don’t get up. Stay there. To move is to change. To change is to become someone else. To become someone else is to die. Stay still. Stay very very still. Every action is destruction of the world as you know it. Do you like this moment? Well, then if you do something, anything, just the slightest breath of change, this moment will die. It will be murdered. Murdered by time, with you as its accomplice. Stasis. Don’t do it. Everything’s fine, just as it is, right now.

          There are no smooth flats. It’s all precipice. Always. And sometimes we are facing the precipice, and sometimes we are turned away. But it is always there, and we are always teetering. And maybe the fall isn’t even the worst part. Maybe, when we fall, there is at least the relief that we know we’re falling. No more uncertainty. Maybe the worst part is the teetering, the teetering for years and years.

          When WTNV entered the podcasting scene in 2012, fiction podcasts simply weren't around. If you wanted to listen to a story, you listened to audio books. 
        </p>
        <p class="snipcss0-3-32-34">
          When Joseph Fink &amp; Jeffrey Cranor created WTNV, they created an entirely new genre of podcasting. 
        </p>
        <p class="snipcss0-3-32-35">
          Welcome to Night Vale was a trailblazer for fiction podcasts, one of the first of it's kind to gain traction and popularity. Long form fiction podcasts today would not be around if not for the creation of WTNV.
        </p>
        <p class="snipcss0-3-32-36">
          Additionally, WTNV should be praised for trailblazing LGBTQ+ representation in a casual yet completely impactful way. In 2012, queer characters were few and far between. Gay characters were generally underdevloped side characters that were killed off for shock value, and gay representation was not yet mainstream enough to be considered profitable for major sudios. 
        </p>
        <p class="snipcss0-3-32-37">
          Night Vale's radio host, Cecil, is revealed to be gay in episode one, when he proclaims his love for Carlos, a visiting Scientist. There is no grand coming out. The way that his sexuality is introduced to the listeners is completely casual, simply a fact of life. While this may not seem groundbreaking today, in 2012 such representation was quite frankly unheard of. 
        </p>
        <p class="snipcss0-3-32-38">
          WHile Joseph Fink &amp; Jeffrey Cranor have done a wonderful job writing inclusive and postiive queer storylines in WTNV, it  should be noted that Cecil's voice actor, Cecil Baldwin, is the one who pushed for his character to be openly gay like himself.

          One of the most well-known segments of WTNV is the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally occuring 3/4ths of the way into the episode, Cecil will direct our attention to the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weather is not a news segment about the weather, but in face a song. music is usually provided by disparition or other indie artists.
