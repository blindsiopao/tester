i've had such a strange few months.. i think i'm finally reaching the end half of a really low depressive phase and hopefully heading towards happier (or at least more productive) times.. <img src="heartdoodle.gif" height="15px"> i have lot of trouble writing diary entries when things aren't really going well for me, it feels so vulnerable and it's so much easier to ignore it and act like i'm doing okay. i'm starting to make productive changes in my life and i think i'm moving in the right direction. i took the fall semester off, so i really want to make the most out of this time to get myself sorted before finishing up uni in the spring!! i think i can do it <img src="armup.gif" height="16px"><br><br>

ahh i feel so motivated to become the person i want 2 be. it's so crazy 2 think about how the last time i was working on my site a lot was when i was in the hospital and couldn't walk + was in so much pain and sadness every day <img src="https://bbstar.neocities.org/graphics/emoji/melo%20cry.gif"> but now i'm getting so strong and healthy and i have a life again!! it has been rly hard getting back into the world after everything i went thru.. but i am getting better each time i put myself out there! i am making new friends and trying new things and am starting to feel like myself again i'm also going to see death grips and joeyy this month! overall i just feel really happy lately and feel so grateful that i have my life and health back ^___^
